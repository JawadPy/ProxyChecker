# Proxy Checkers
Check each proxy in your proxy list, if you don't have a proxy list you can get one too!

## Installation
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Run
To get and check updated proxies for free, run:
`python main.py`


otherwise you can import your proxy list by creating `proxylist.txt` in main directory,
then set `main(online=False)` in `main.py` file.
